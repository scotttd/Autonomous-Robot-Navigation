# Autonomous-Robot-Navigation
This is an experiment in autonomous robot navigation codes. 

It is built on a lot a work from others.  I hope to document all the sources as this moves along.

##IMU - The art of Gyro, Accel and Mag sensors

[FreeIMU website](http://www.varesano.net/projects/hardware/FreeIMU)

The MotionPlug unit is coming. Hardware [documentation for the MotionPlug from Modern Device](https://moderndevice.com/product/motion-plug/). Here is [Motionplug Code for Arduino with DMP](https://github.com/moderndevice/MotionPlug)

Very Good: [Kalman filter vs Complementary filter](http://robottini.altervista.org/kalman-filter-vs-complementary-filter)

Using the gyro, Mag and Accel to help with weaknesses can be found here: [A practical approach to Kalman filter and how to implement it](http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/2012/09/a-practical-approach-to-kalman-filter-and-how-to-implement-it/)

##Motion Control Profiles - Smooth Movement

[2015 FIRST World Championships Conference - Motion Planning & Control in FRC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8319J1BEHwM) - CheesyPoofs FRC 254 Presentation and [the Powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xjtQ5m3Ay4AYxS_SfloF2n_vWZnCU25aXZuu9A59xPY/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g76b62f478_0_31) to that presentation.
